<h1><b>Coffee</b></h1>
<hr/>

<p>Coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin. <br/>
    Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities.<br/>
     Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, including espresso, cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.</p>
<p>Two species of coffee plants, Coffea arabica and C. canephora, supply almost all of the world’s consumption.
     Arabica is considered a milder and more flavourful and aromatic brew than Robusta, the main variety of C.
      canephora. The flatter and more elongated Arabica bean is more widespread than Robusta but more delicate and vulnerable to pests, requiring a cool subtropical climate; Arabica must grow at higher elevations (2,000–6,500 feet [600–2,000 metres]), it needs a lot of moisture, and it has fairly specific shade requirements.
       Latin America, eastern Africa, Asia, and Arabia are leading producers of Arabica coffee. The rounder, more convex Robusta bean, as its name suggests, is hardier and can grow at lower altitudes (from sea level to 2,000 feet). 
       Robusta coffee is cheaper to produce, has twice the caffeine content of Arabica, and is typically the bean of choice for inexpensive commercial coffee brands. 
    Western and Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and Brazil are major producers of Robusta coffee.</p>
    <h1>History</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Wild coffee plants, probably from Kefa (Kaffa), Ethiopia, were taken to southern Arabia and placed under cultivation in the 15th century. 
        One of many legends about the discovery of coffee is that of Kaldi, an Arab goatherd who was puzzled by the strange antics of his flock.
         About 850 CE Kaldi supposedly sampled the berries of the evergreen bush on which the goats were feeding and, on experiencing a sense of exhilaration, proclaimed his discovery to the world.</p>
    <p>Whatever the actual origin of coffee, its stimulating effect undoubtedly made it popular.
         Ironically, though Islamic authorities pronounced the drink intoxicating and therefore prohibited by the Qurʾān, many Muslims were attracted to the beverage as a substitute for alcohol, also prohibited by the Qurʾān. 
         Despite the threat of severe penalties, coffee drinking spread rapidly among Arabs and their neighbours and even gave rise to a new social and cultural entity, the coffeehouse.</p>
    <p>Coffee was introduced into one European country after another throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. 
        Many accounts are recorded of its prohibition or approval as a religious, political, and medical potion. 
        By the end of the 17th century, coffeehouses were flourishing across Britain, the British colonies in America, and continental Europe.</p>
    <p>Until the close of the 17th century, the world’s limited supply of coffee was obtained almost entirely from the province of Yemen in southern Arabia.
         But, with the increasing popularity of the beverage, propagation of the plant spread rapidly to Java and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago in the 17th century and to the Americas in the 18th century. 
        Coffee cultivation was started in the Hawaiian Islands in 1825.</p>
    <p>By the 20th century the greatest concentration of production was centred in the Western Hemisphere—particularly Brazil.
         In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, industrial roasting and grinding machines came into use, vacuum-sealed containers were invented for ground roasts, and decaffeination methods for green coffee beans were developed. 
         After 1950 the production of instant coffee was perfected, which led to increased production of the cheaper Robusta beans in Africa. See also history of coffee.

    <h1>Unique Benefits of Coffee</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>1. Boosts energy levels</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels (1Trusted Source).</li>

     <li>This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, and this increases levels of other neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate your energy levels, including dopamine (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).</li>
        
     <li>One small study found that consuming caffeine increased time to exhaustion during a cycling exercise by 12% and significantly reduced subjective levels of fatigue in participants (4Trusted Source). </li>
        
     <li>Another study had similar findings, reporting that consuming caffeine before and during a round of golf improved performance, increased subjective energy levels, and reduced feelings of fatigue (5Trusted SourceTrusted Source).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. May be linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Some research suggests that consuming coffee regularly could be associated with a decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the long term.</li>
    <li>In fact, one review of 30 studies found that each cup of coffee people consumed per day was linked to a 6% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (6Trusted Source).</li> 
    <li>This is thought to be due to coffee’s ability to preserve the function of the beta cells in your pancreas, which are responsible for producing insulin to regulate blood sugar levels (7Trusted Source).</li>
    <li>Plus, it’s rich in antioxidants and may affect insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and metabolism — all of which are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes (8Trusted Source).</li>
</ul> 
    <h2>3. Could support brain health</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Although studies have turned up mixed results, some research suggests that coffee may help protect against certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.</li>
    <li>According to one review of 13 studies, people who regularly consumed caffeine had a significantly lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. What’s more, caffeine consumption also slowed the progression of Parkinson’s disease over time (9Trusted Source).</li>
    <li>Another review of 11 observational studies in more than 29,000 people also found that the more coffee people consumed, the lower their risk of Alzheimer’s disease (10Trusted Source).</li>
    <li>Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that moderate coffee consumption could be associated with a lower risk of dementia and cognitive decline (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).</li>
</ul>
    <h2>4. May promote weight management</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>According to some research, coffee could alter fat storage and support gut health, both of which may be beneficial for weight management (13Trusted Source).</li>
    <li>For example, one review of 12 studies concluded that higher coffee consumption could be associated with decreased body fat, especially in men (14Trusted Source).</li>
    <li>In another study, increased coffee intake was linked to decreased body fat in women (15Trusted Source).</li>
    <li>Furthermore, one study found that people who drank one to two cups of coffee per day were 17% more likely to meet recommended physical activity levels, compared with those who drank less than one cup per day (16Trusted Source).</li>
</ul>

    <h2>5. Some studies have found that drinking coffee could be associated with a lower risk of depression.</h2>
    <ul>
   <li>According to one review of seven studies, each cup of coffee people consumed per day was linked to an 8% lower risk of depression (17Trusted Source).</li>
   <li>Another study found that drinking at least four cups of coffee each day was associated with a significantly lower risk of depression, compared with drinking just one cup per day (18Trusted Source).</li>
   <li>What’s more, one study in more than 200,000 people showed that drinking coffee was linked to a lower risk of death by suicide (19Trusted Source).
